Game of Life is a simple ruby implementation of Conway's Game of Life

This project is terribly unfinished, but works.

== Instalation ==
You probably need the 'colorize' gem installed

  > gem install colorize

To start, make sure play.rb is set to executable 

  > chmod +x play.rb

Then simply run 

  > ./play.rb

== How it works ==

Code generates a random world of live "Os" and dead "Xs" and then dumps every cycle to a timestamped folder in the 'plays' directory

Styling is tied directly to the data with the 'colorize' gem though, the outputted files are ugly unless viewed in the commandline. Sorry

== Todo ==
*Read from file
*Escape data from styling
